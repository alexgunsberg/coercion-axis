# Coercion Axis is now open source

Most political quizzes hide their weighting logic.

So I built an auditable alternative: **Coercion Axis** (Pakkoakseli).

What is open now:
- Every question and score scale
- The full scoring math
- A runnable simulator

No black box weighting. No hidden dimensions.

Current status:
- UI/docs are English-first
- Finnish source wording is preserved
- Full English question translation is in progress

Contributions and criticism are welcome.
